# Serverless-Webhosting
ðŸ§© Overview

This project demonstrates how to host and deploy a Python-based application on a fully serverless AWS architecture using the following services:

Amazon S3 â€“ for static file hosting (frontend, assets)

AWS Lambda â€“ for backend logic and API endpoints

Amazon API Gateway â€“ to expose Lambda functions as REST APIs

Amazon DynamoDB â€“ for scalable, serverless database storage

Amazon CloudFront â€“ as a global CDN for caching and secure content delivery

The architecture eliminates the need for managing traditional servers, ensuring high scalability, low operational overhead, and cost efficiency.
